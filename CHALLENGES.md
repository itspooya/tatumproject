# Challenges I faced

1. How to design a microservice architecture for this project
2. How to implement CI/CD
3. Which functions need to be static and which functions need to be in the class
4. Should Project be in one folder or each one should be in different folders or even different projects?
5. HOW to support both gcp and aws at the same time in each part
6. Can I get project name or id for terraform from service account key file
7. How to build inventory for ansible in current CI/CD approach and multiline YAML
8. High availability was from the start of project in my mind, but how to implement it would need more thought
9. Whether to use Traefik, Nginx, Caddy or Envoy for reverse proxy
